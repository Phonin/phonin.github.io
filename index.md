# [![Phonin](https://phonin.github.io/Branding/icons/phonin.svg)](https://phonin.github.io/Browser/)

Phonin is a browser which you can disguise as a password manager or 2FA Application, as to prevent censorship from people such as your parents, or your workplace, or whoever you don't want to know your Browsing Activities.

Phonin is built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), which itself is built on the open-source [Chromium](https://chromium.org/) project, which raises the question: Why not just fork Chromium?
Chromium's UI is not built using the actual rendering engine, causing chromium to be slower. Phonin's UI, in comparison, is built entirely using [Preact](https://preactjs.com)

(If that is your only reason for trying this browser, you might also be interested in [Wexond](https://wexond.net/) - but still consider this browser please :D)

See [This](https://phonin.github.io/Browser/) for more information.

## Notice

The Github Pages sites are meant as a more bare-bones description of Phonin, and not a full site about it.<br/>
A full site will be in the works **as soon as Phonin v1.0.0 is released**

The browser, at the time of writing, is in a **developmental stage**. It is not stable, and won't be for near future. Expect frequent crashes.
